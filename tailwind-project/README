Make sure you provide the correct path to the html file so that the changes can be detected by tailwind to and source a new css file each time 
A complete path towards the html file
All these is done inside the tailwind.config.json
Follow closely the steps carefully this is json we are working with
Look inside the file correctly especially the curly brackets
overflow-hidden anything going beyond the specified style will be ignored and hidden
Use shadow-<choose> for applying all the styles you need
Rounded coners to more like the border radius different sizes are applied
Learn to use the specified length to use
Trick for reapplying the same classes in tailwind 
Go to the src file add the class name and then add the @apply function followed by all the classes difined there
then restart the the builder for css using tailwind which to me is dev
Anything not supported by the tailwind css builder will not be detected in the live-server side
